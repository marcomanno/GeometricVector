# GeometricVector

A class for vector algebra.
Sometime it is seful to have a little class to be plugged in other project.
The class does not have dependencies frm header standard header files,
so can be used as an interface class.

It implements class
Vect
Vers (a vector of length 1)

Vect can be used to store positions.


Implements these methods:
+, -, len, len_sq, dot, cross (only 3 by 3)

Anyone is welcome to improve this class.
